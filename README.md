A simplified metaheuristics framework for .NET
==============================================

# Purpose

This framework is designed to incorporate the state of the art in metaheuristics software frameworks, yet limiting the software complexity to users who are interested in applying it without advanced knowledge of software or optimisation research. It has been used mainly to calibrate environmental models, mostly hydrology models.

The purpose of this framework is to define a set of programming interface, rather than replicate optimisation algorithms found in other optimisation frameworks.

# License

This software is released under the LGPL v2.1. See LICENSE.txt.

# Requirements

This framework is written in C#, and designed to compile to target .NET v4.0. Some projects depend on NUnit and Entity Framework, using NuGet packages.

It is developed and tested on Microsoft .NET 4.0 for Windows and for Linux on using Mono 3.0.x or 3.2.x and MonoDevelop 4.2. It is likely to work as is on MacOS using a similar Mono/MonoDevelop setup, but has not been tested.

# Getting started
